                    Mysteries of the World
    When I stopped believing in Santa Claus is a silly inquiry
that can't even serve as a conversation opener. But if you must
know till when I believed in him, well, I'm pretty sure that I
never believed in this imaginary old man in a red suit from the
very beginning.
    The Santa that appeared at a Christmas event at my
kindergarten was a fake and I knew it. Come to think of it, as
far back as I can remember, all the other kids were equally
suspicious, eyeing the principal as though he was dressed
in a Santa costume for a play.
    Of course I never saw my mom kissing Santa Claus, but I was a
smart kid to doubt that an old man existed who only worked
at Christmastime. However, it took much longer for even an
intelligent kid like me to realize that spacemen, future-
men, ghosts, goblins, ESP, evil organizations and the like did not
exist in this world, nor did animated cartoon characters, special-
effect comic book archenemy heroes to fight them.
    Well, I may have known and pretended not to know. I must
admit that deep down inside, I was truly longing for an
encounter with spacemen, future-men, ghosts, goblins, ESP or
some secret, evil organization to happen to make their
appearance before me.
